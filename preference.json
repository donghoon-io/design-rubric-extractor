That balance is essential for a music player app, as the visual appeal of the space for the artwork and track information is important for users who want to share what they're listening to on social media, but the size and placement of the controls are necessary to actually use the player. There are minor tweaks needed for A's icons, but B places too much importance on the album artwork and there is no space for the controls, making the design look squished at the bottom and unusable."
